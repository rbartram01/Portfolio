                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am an aspiring web developer who has recently completed a web development course to further my knowledge and abilities. I have experience working with responsive, front end and back end websites. I am seeking a position with a leading company in web development.
                        <br><br>
                        I started web developing with no experience and have progressed to design and create bespoke websites. Whilst working for Computer Lifeline I worked on and created over 15 websites. I have experience working with WordPress and an inhouse content management system. I also helped with back end developing for a booking system, this involved the setup of database tables. I attended meetings with customers to better understand their website requirements and to get feedback from the customer enabling me to make any necessary changes. While the websites were in development, I gave the customers access to a subdomain for testing purposes. All websites were created to be compatible with different browsers and to respond to different screen sizes. I assisted with SEO by setting up and managing relevant keywords in Google AdWords. I also created a Google My Business account to give me an insight on the website traffic. I also changed the metadata tags to boost the website visibility with the search engines. I used the skills that I learnt from image manipulation to design posters, leaflets and flyers that were used to market the business, as well as written adverts for the local newspaper and social media.
                        <br><br>
                        I am an honest and friendly person who likes to be organised enabling me to meet deadlines and prioritise my workload. I can work from my own initiative as well as work as a team. I love to be challenged as it means I can expand my knowledge which helps me to keep up to date with the latest technologies. Being interested in the IT, I like to read the latest tech articles whether that is from hidden tricks on an iPhone to Cyber Attacks. In my spare time I like to listen to music and spend time with my family.  I also like to learn new skills for example I am currently learning more about Javascript.
